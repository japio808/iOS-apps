## About

I am an iOS developer who loves writing code and helping people solve code problems. As I was growing up, I had a real interest in technology. I would always be the one to take apart gaming consoles and other devices to try and fix them and see how they worked. I didn't ruin any devices because they were already broken. As I got older, I had a deep interest in software and data. I went to Post University to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) with a concentration in software development. After that, I decided to pursue my education for a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Denver.
